# macsign

A general-purpose shell script for signing and notarizing applications on macOS.

## Overview

Signing macOS applications is difficult without Xcode, and documentation is
hard to find. This script provides an easy method for projects which use
alternative build tools, such as CMake or Cargo.

Currently, this script only signs and notarizes standalone `.app` bundles. It
does not yet have support for `.dmg` or `.pkg` (this is planned).

It has been successfully tested on 16/12/24 using macOS 14.3, but should work
on up to macOS 15.2.

Note that you will need to be a registered Apple Developer *and* have a
"Developer Application ID" certificate.

## Usage

Simply run `macsign.sh` to see the following message:

```shell
Fatal: received arguments are invalid

Usage:
  ./sign.sh [path to .app file to sign] [Apple ID email] [Apple Developer team ID] [app-specific password]

Note: check that all spaces are escaped with '\' in the app path
Note: the app-specific password must be generated by the Apple ID used for signing at https://account.apple.com/account/manage
Note: use the following command to show Apple codesigning IDs
  $ security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add details for obtaining a "Developer Application ID" certificate, which
  can be an awkward process
- [ ] Add a script for generating and signing `.pkg` bundles
- [ ] Add a script for generating and signing `.dmg` bundles
